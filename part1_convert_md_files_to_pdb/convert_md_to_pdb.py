# You'll need to install MDAnalysis on your computer.
#     See http://www.mdanalysis.org/
# I recommend installing miniconda python and then following these
# instructions to install:
#     http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html
#     http://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/installation_quick_start/


# Steps:
#     Use MDAnalysis to load in a dcd and psf file (samples in this directory).
#         This might help: https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/overview.html
#         Maybe this too: https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/Examples#user-content-file-format-conversion
#     Save that MD simulations to a PDB file using MDAnalysis.
